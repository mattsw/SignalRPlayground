# Project objective / scope
This project is to demonstrate my coding style and decision making building a lightweight chat client in the browser that will accept user first and last name and give them a unique userid for the duration of their time with the browser window open.
It will focus primarily on
- using SignalR for communicating changes to user credentials and chat message updates
- elementary database management with entity framework core
- use of adapter pattern to facilitate the change from a legacy user manager to a more modern one
- primarily TDD where the test starts as failure and should end in the development of a feature test by test

It is my hope through the commit frequency, units of work completed, design decisions, comments, technologies, and language mastery that I demonstrate my ability to learn, adapt, and adopt new technologies.
